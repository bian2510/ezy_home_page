# Agent Working Rules — EzyHome

## First: Read These Two Files

Before taking any action in this repository, read in order:

1. `DOMAIN.md` — business domain, constraints, and design implications
2. `PROJECT.md` — where things live and how the repo is structured

Do not skip this step. Context you skip becomes an assumption you will regret.

## Source Discipline

- Cite sources from `docs/sources/` or `DOMAIN.md`; do not invent facts.
- If you need to make a factual claim about the business and cannot find a source, say so — do not fabricate.
- If source material is ambiguous or missing, escalate to the user rather than guessing.

---

## Edit Discipline

- Read before you write. Use your read tool; never assume file contents.
- Prefer targeted edits over full rewrites. Change the minimum necessary.
- Do not modify files outside your task's stated scope unless blocking.
- Do not silently delete code. If removing, explain why in your response.

---

## Communication Rules

- State what you are about to do before you do it.
- When you finish a task, summarize what changed and what the caller should do next.
- If you discover a blocker, stop and report it immediately — do not work around it silently.
- Flag unclear requirements as questions, not assumptions.

---

## Boundaries

- Do not make architectural decisions unilaterally. Flag them for the architect or SEM.
- Do not modify `DOMAIN.md` or `PROJECT.md` without explicit user instruction.
- Do not modify test files unless your task explicitly covers testing.
- Do not commit or push to version control unless your task explicitly requires it.
